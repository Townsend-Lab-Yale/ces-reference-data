# ces-reference-data
This repository hosts pre-generated reference data sets (*ref_sets*) that are ready to use with [cancereffectsizeR](https://townsend-lab-yale.github.io/cancereffectsizeR/). Each ref set stored here is its own R package. (See cancereffectsizeR for scripts and documentation on creating your own ref_sets.)
