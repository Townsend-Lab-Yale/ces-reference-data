# ces-reference-data
This repository hosts pre-generated reference data sets (*ref_sets*) that are ready to use with [cancereffectsizeR](https://townsend-lab-yale.github.io/cancereffectsizeR/). You can copy individual reference data sets to your cancereffectsizeR installation using cancereffectsizeR's `install_ref_set()` function. Typically, you won't need to download directly from this repositority, but you might want to do so if you're building a custom reference data set and want to build off of the data here. (See cancereffectsizeR for scripts and documentation on creating your own ref_sets.)
